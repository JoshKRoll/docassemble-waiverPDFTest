  **Next Steps:** What to expect if your fee waiver is denied without a hearing
subquestion: |
  Your fee waiver application may be denied without a hearing for 1 of 2 reasons:

  - It is incomplete; or
  - From your application, the court decided you are not eligible for the fee waiver.
 
  The judge will check the reason for denying your request on page 2 of Form FW-003.

  If your fee waiver is denied without a hearing, you have 10 days from the date in the Clerk's Certificate of Service (at the bottom of page 2 of Form FW-003 or attached to that form) to:

  - Pay your fees;
  - File a new request if the court found that your request was incomplete; OR
  - Ask for a hearing to show the court more information.

  **If you do not do 1 of these 3 things, the court will cancel the papers you filed with your fee waiver request and you can miss important deadlines or have to start your case all over.**
